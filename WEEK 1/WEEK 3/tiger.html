                    <h3>TIGER</h3>
                    <p>The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest living cat species and a member of the genus Panthera. It is most recognizable for its dark vertical stripes on orange-brown fur with a lighter underside. Tigers are apex predators, primarily preying on ungulates such as deer and wild boar.</p>
                    <p>There are several subspecies of tiger, including the Bengal tiger, Siberian tiger, Sumatran tiger, and othersâ€”each adapted to different environments across Asia. They are solitary and territorial animals. Unlike many other cats, tigers are strong swimmers and often cool off in lakes or streams during hot weather.</p>
                    <p>Tigers are classified as endangered, with all subspecies facing threats from habitat loss, poaching, and human-wildlife conflict. Conservation efforts are underway in many countries to protect their populations.</p>
                    <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
                    <p>You will find the tigers opposite the gorillas.</p>
